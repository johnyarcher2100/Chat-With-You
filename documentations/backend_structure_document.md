# Backend Structure Document

This document explains the backend setup for the "Chat with Me" project in everyday language. It covers our architecture, data handling, API design, hosting, and more. Each section is detailed so that anyone, regardless of technical background, can understand how we have assembled the backend infrastructure.

## Backend Architecture

The "Chat with Me" backend is built to be both powerful and flexible. We use a mix of modern, easy-to-scale technologies and best practices:

- **Design & Frameworks:**
  - Our main platform is Supabase, which offers a robust backend with PostgreSQL (for our database), real-time capabilities, and built-in authentication.
  - We supplement authentication with Clerk Auth, ensuring multiple layers of secure user identification.
  - For our AI functionality, we integrate with OpenAI API and deepseekAPI.

- **Architecture Benefits:**
  - **Scalability:** The use of cloud-based services like Supabase and Netlify ensures we can handle increased load and real-time messaging without performance hiccups.
  - **Maintainability:** With clear separation of concerns, the code is modular, meaning each component (authentication, messaging, payment, etc.) can be updated independently.
  - **Performance:** Real-time messaging and caching strategies are in place to deliver a fast and responsive user experience.

## Database Management

Data management is key, especially in a social chat application that manages lots of interactions. Here’s how we manage our data:

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Supabase:** Provides a PostgreSQL database for our central storage and robust APIs.
  - **Cloudinary:** Used for storing and serving media (avatars, chat images).

- **Data Structuring & Practices:**
  - We store user profiles, friendships, chat messages, and AI interactions in dedicated tables.
  - The database is normalized to avoid duplicate data and improve consistency.
  - Real-time updates keep messages and notifications up-to-date on all devices.

## Database Schema

Below is an overview of our database schema for the SQL-based PostgreSQL environment provided by Supabase. Think of it like a series of linked spreadsheets:

- **Users:** Contains details like user IDs, names, login methods, and profile information.
- **Friends:** Manage friend relationships using user IDs, friend status, and request info.
- **Messages:** Stores all chat messages with sender and receiver IDs, timestamps, and content.
- **Chats:** Holds information for chat sessions, which can include group chats or one-on-one conversations.
- **AI_Interactions:** Logs AI queries and responses for context-aware suggestions.
- **Payments:** Keeps track of any transaction details including usage metering for AI calls and balance alerts.
- **Media:** A reference table for Cloudinary links to store chat images and avatars.
- **Admin_Config:** Stores admin settings, analytics parameters, and API usage limits.

For clarity, here’s a simplified SQL structure outline (non-code detailed description):

- Table: USERS
  - Columns: id, name, email, password, auth_provider, profile_image_url

- Table: FRIENDS
  - Columns: id, user_id, friend_id, status, created_at

- Table: MESSAGES
  - Columns: id, chat_id, sender_id, message_content, timestamp, status

- Table: CHATS
  - Columns: id, chat_type (one-on-one/group), last_message_timestamp

- Table: AI_INTERACTIONS
  - Columns: id, user_id, query, response, created_at

- Table: PAYMENTS
  - Columns: id, user_id, amount, provider, transaction_date, status

- Table: MEDIA
  - Columns: id, user_id, media_url, media_type, uploaded_at

- Table: ADMIN_CONFIG
  - Columns: id, parameter, value, updated_at

## API Design and Endpoints

We designed our APIs to be straightforward and user-friendly. The structure relies on RESTful practices supported by Supabase and complementary authentication services:

- **Key Points:**
  - **RESTful Endpoints:** Each concept (e.g., users, messages, friends) has an endpoint.
  - **Real-time API:** Endpoints for messaging use either Supabase Realtime or WebSocket, ensuring messages are updated instantly.

- **Some Important Endpoints Include:**
  - **Authentication:** Sign-in, sign-up, token refresh (managed by Supabase and Clerk Auth).
  - **Messaging:** Endpoints to send, receive, and fetch chat history.
  - **Friend Management:** Search for users, send friend requests, manage notifications.
  - **AI Assistance:** Endpoints to interact with the integrated AI services (OpenAI and deepseekAPI).
  - **Payments:** Endpoints for processing transactions, balance checks, and recharge operations.
  - **Media Uploads:** Handling file uploads and serving media through Cloudinary.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted in a cloud environment focused on reliability and scalability. Here’s how:

- **Cloud Providers & Platforms:**
  - **Supabase:** We use their hosted platform for our database, authentication, and real-time services.
  - **Netlify:** Hosts our web-based components, ensuring fast and consistent front-end deployment.
  - **GitHub:** Manages our codebase with continuous integration and version control.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reliability:** Cloud-based hosting ensures minimal downtime and automatic backups.
  - **Scalability:** Easily scale as user numbers grow, thanks to Supabase and Netlify's auto-scaling capabilities.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go pricing and efficient resource management keep expenses predictable.

## Infrastructure Components

Several key components work together to ensure our system is fast, reliable, and secure:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic efficiently across backend services.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Implement caching to serve frequently accessed data quickly, reducing the load on the database.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Netlify and Cloudinary work as CDNs to provide rapid content delivery globally.
- **Real-Time Messaging Services:** Using Supabase Realtime or WebSocket to deliver instant updates to the app.

Each component contributes to a smooth user experience by balancing loads, reducing latency, and ensuring that all parts of the system communicate effectively.

## Security Measures

Security is woven into every aspect of the backend to protect user data and maintain trust:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Use of Supabase authentication and Clerk Auth ensures reliable user login and session management.
  - Support for third-party login methods (Facebook, Google, Apple) adds extra security layers.

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (within the database).

- **API Key Management:**
  - All sensitive keys (e.g., OpenAI API keys, deepseekAPI keys) are safely stored using environment variables which are never exposed to the public.

- **Security Practices:**
  - Regular audits and updates to manage vulnerabilities.
  - Rate limiting on APIs to prevent abuse, especially with deepseekAPI and OpenAI services.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Maintaining a healthy backend is crucial. Here’s our approach:

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Supabase provides dashboards and logging to oversee database health and usage.
  - Third-party monitoring tools can be integrated if needed (e.g., for real-time error tracking and performance analytics).

- **Regular Maintenance:**
  - Scheduled backups and updates to dependencies and libraries.
  - Performance reviews to ensure that scaling strategies are still effective.

- **Incident Response:**
  - Clear procedures are in place for addressing issues quickly and minimizing downtime.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

To wrap it up, the backend of the "Chat with Me" project is designed to be robust, secure, and scalable. Here’s a quick review:

- **Architecture:** Built on Supabase with PostgreSQL, integrating real-time updates, third-party APIs, and secure authentication.
