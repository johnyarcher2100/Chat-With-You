# Chat with Me App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user discovers the Chat with Me app, they are welcomed by a minimalist, Apple-inspired landing page that immediately communicates simplicity and elegance. From this interface, the user is offered several options to create an account or sign in using popular third-party authentication methods such as Facebook, Google, and Apple, all seamlessly integrated via Supabase. During the sign-up process, users are guided through entering only necessary information, and environment variables securely manage all sensitive data like API keys. If a returning user forgets their password, a clear and intuitive process allows for password recovery and secure account access. The onboarding experience not only creates an account but also provides a brief introduction to key app features such as real-time chat, AI-assisted responses, and friend management, ensuring a smooth start on any device whether on Android, iOS, or the Web.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once the user successfully logs in, they are taken directly to the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all activities. The home page is designed with clarity in mind, featuring a clean interface that includes a header with essential navigation options, a sidebar for accessing chat lists, friend requests, and quick links to profile settings. The layout maintains the Apple design aesthetic with subtle shadows, ample white space, and harmonious layouts. Here, the user immediately sees ongoing conversations along with indicators for unread messages or notifications. Navigation is highly intuitive with clearly marked buttons and smooth transitions, making it simple for the user to move between chats, search for friends, manage notifications, or access additional features such as the integrated payment system for AI functionalities.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
After the main dashboard, the user journey unfolds into several interconnected modules. In the chat section, users can engage in real-time messaging powered by Supabase Realtime or WebSocket technology. A conversation page opens when a user selects a chat, displaying the complete history of messages that have been persisted in the database. Even if a user goes offline, the app caches messages locally and synchronizes them automatically when connectivity returns, ensuring that no part of the conversation is lost.

In parallel, the AI-assisted chat feature is accessible within the conversation page. This area displays context-based suggestions and simulated reply options when one party is inactive. The AI panel integrates deepseekAPI and OpenAI API to offer customized interaction cues and tone-matched responses. Additionally, users who desire more personalization can switch to a dedicated section for custom AI bot management, where they can tailor bot behavior using pre-set training prompts for knowledge-based or order-based tasks.

The friend management module is another critical feature. Users can search for new friends using an ID, name, or even a personal QR code generated uniquely for every user. A dedicated friend request page handles sending, accepting, or rejecting friend invitations, with built-in notifications ensuring that every request is handled securely and deliberately. Transitions between these pages are smooth, allowing users to go back to their chat dashboard with ease.

Moreover, the payment system for managing AI call charges is seamlessly integrated into the user flow. When users reach a point where premium AI features are triggered, they are directed to a payment interface. Here, the user can check their current balance, receive low balance alerts, and choose to top up their account using local payment providers such as 街口支付 or Line Pay. The transition back to the chat or AI feature is engineered to maintain user engagement without unnecessary steps, ensuring a seamless experience.

Administrators have their separate pathway within the app. The admin interface offers a dashboard for managing LLM parameters, viewing aggregated statistics on AI calls, and monitoring user activity. This section is accessible only after secure authentication and provides tools for dynamic adjustments, data insights, and overall management of the communication environment. The admin panel is a crucial part of the system, tying advanced system insights back into the primary user flow without interfering with the everyday experience of regular users.

## Settings and Account Management
Users can access a dedicated settings panel from the main dashboard at any time. In this area, they can update personal information, change authentication settings including linked social accounts, and adjust notification preferences. The profile settings page also provides comprehensive controls for customizing display options — all while preserving the overall Apple-inspired, clean design. For users who need to manage billing or check details about AI usage, the settings panel includes access to payment histories, low balance alerts, and options for topping up using integrated payment options like 街口支付 and Line Pay. After making any changes, users are given a clear pathway to return to the main application flow, ensuring that adjustments are completed quickly and without disruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Throughout the application, robust error handling is built into every stage of the user journey. If a user enters incorrect credentials during sign-in, they are immediately provided with a clear error message that explains the problem and offers the option to try again or choose a password recovery process. In the event of network issues leading to lost connectivity, users are informed through pop-up messages on screen, and the app automatically switches to an offline mode that allows message caching and later synchronization. When restricted actions are attempted — for instance, trying to send a message to a non-friend or accessing an admin-only feature without appropriate permissions — the system displays precise, non-technical error prompts that explain why the action could not be completed and often suggest the next steps. These error states ensure that the user is never left confused or stranded, guiding them back to the correct navigation paths while maintaining a secure environment.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The complete app journey for Chat with Me is a seamless experience that begins with a straightforward sign-up or log-in process, continues with a well-organized main dashboard that offers instant access to real-time chats, AI-assisted conversations, and friend management, and extends into advanced features such as payment for AI interactions and dedicated administrative controls. Every page and user action is connected through intuitive navigation, ensuring that whether a user is sending a message, managing friendships, or configuring a custom AI bot, they are supported by a coherent, beautifully designed interface. The error handling and fallback mechanisms guarantee that any disruption in service is quickly remedied through clear instructions and automatic recovery, making the entire journey from onboarding to everyday use a cohesive and engaging experience.
